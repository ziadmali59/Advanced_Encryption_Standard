Implementation of AES-128-bit encryption
AES-128 is a symmetric encryption algorithm that operates on fixed-size blocks of data.
It uses a 128-bit key, which means the key length is 128 bits.
AES-128 consists of 10 rounds of transformations for encryption and decryption.
The algorithm includes steps such as SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey.
It provides confidentiality by encrypting plaintext into ciphertext, AES-128 is widely used and considered secure for various applications.
